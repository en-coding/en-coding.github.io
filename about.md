## About me

Eijy is a computational biologist

Eijy was always interested in studying life and the mechanisms behind the orchestration of the natural functions of living beings.

Eventually, he became a biotechnologist and studied plants and microorganisms during undergrad. After, cattle and livestock genetic improvements during masters. And finally, reached PhD degree studying the malfunction of cells in the immune systems of mammals.

He is interested in all kinds of [OMICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics) flavors, with a focus on transcriptomics and epigenetics. He has experience in data analysis in scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, bulk RNA-seq, 3D genome (Hi-C), and ChIP-seq. 

His background is mostly in biology, but studied and learned (or kind of) how to program and became able to write scripts in Bash, R, and Python. **This blog aims to help him improve and share some knowledge in bioinformatics and related stuff**. He is almost all the time a positive mind and friendly guy, but do not disturb him if he didn't have his daily dosage of good coffee. 

When he is not behind a monitor, he is disconnected doing [hiking and taking photos](https://www.instagram.com/nagai2030/) =)

## About this blog

This blog has two goals:
1. Make Eijy a better coder;
2. Do not forget the first goal

Eijy believes in the [70:20:10 learning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70/20/10_Model_(Learning_and_Development)) to learn effectively. Basically, when learning new things you should spend around 10% of the time learning from content, 20% from others, and 70% by doing it! So, to improve the practical time I found out that blogging is really a large amount of time preparing the material and keep track of your evolution. Also, if the content is good enough, it can contribute to others and people may interact to support possible improvements. So it is a win-win.

That's it for now. Stay tunned ;)
