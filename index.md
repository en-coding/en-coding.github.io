# Eijy Nagai coding blog<br>

### This blog has two goals:<br>
#### 1. Make me a better coder;<br>
#### 2. Do not forget the first goal<br>

I will mostly write short tutorials on data analysis for bioninformatics based on my own experience and community survey.<br>
And, hopefully, I will improve my skills as well becoming able to support heavily the bioinformatics community.

That's all for now. Stay tunned!
