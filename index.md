# Eijy Nagai coding BLOG  

### This blog has two goals:  
#### 1. Make me a better coder  
#### 2. Do not forget the first goal  

I will mostly write short tutorials on data analysis for bioninformatics.
And hopefully little by little will improve my skills as well becoming able to support the bioinformatics community.

That's all for now. Stay tunned!
