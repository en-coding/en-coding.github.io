# typing accuracy X speed

# 1- What is typing?

# 2- Why typing matters?
    Anyone can type, but typing using multiple fingers usually increase
    the average words you can type. Also, using more fingers distribute 
    the physical stress you would have while using only a few.

# 3- What is a normal speed typing? And how to improve it?
    Practice makes perfect, or practice makes permanent. It doesn't matter if
    you can rest your fingers on top of a key and know which key you will be 
    pressing. Importantly is the coordination when typing and the muscle 
    memory also helps. 

    While you can practice doing your routine such as answering e-mails, 
    replying your friends on social media, or typing on Google search bar,
    you still able to make a focused practice counting how many words you can 
    type per minute (also know as WPM). There are many websites that will do 
    this job for free. For example, X, Y, Z... Also, if you feel bored by doing
    this normal approaches, you can also play games at A, B, TypeRacer 
    (https://play.typeracer.com/) I recommend the former one because you can
    compete with other users and record your own progress.

    Some people also claim that using special keyboards, known as mechanical
    keyboards, makes you type much faster and accurate. There are plenty of 
    brands and types... The time I started typing this post I only had 
    the Apple's magic keyboard with scisors key... but later on, I read
    a lot about mechanical keyboard and got facinated in this new world. 
    I wrote more on this here (future post).

# 4- Accuracy
    Now that you know that typing faster matters, the more important than 
    the speed is the accuracy. If you type incorrectly, you spend 3 movements
    to get the job done of 1 corrected typed word. And even more, because 
    sometimes when you realize you did a mistake, it's already few chracters
    later...

# 5- How to learn typing correctly?
    It's not obligated to use all the fingers to right with high accuracy 
    and fast, but the fastest typers said that using 7 or more fingers is
    a must to be able to type fast enough. To learn how to use all fingers
    to type, check this website https://www.typing.com/. It's free and you
    can practice in a much fun way. If you want to consistently improve 
    your accuracy and speed, they recommend reserving 15 minutes a day for 
    30 days. 

# 6- My personal experience
    As a bioinformatician, my daily work with keyboard is to write scripts, 
    run commands on a terminal, and make some documents in MS Word.
    
    In my first trial I could type at WPM with accuracy of %.
    It's not bad, but I wanted to improve since I felt I wasn't using all 
    my fingers and constantly making errors. So I decided to make the 
    30 days challenge and after that this are my results.


    Of course, there is a learning curve when you start using a totally new
    machine. Until your muscle memory get used to the touch and feeling of 
    using the new object you have to struggle.

    But I have to confess that it is not that difficult to get used to a
    mechanical keyboard. I got a Filco Ninja with brown Cherry switches. 
    It is callled tactile and it is in between the silent red and noisy-clicky
    blue switches. So it means that it is not that noisy, but can respond 
    quite quicly to the touch and it is not necessary to press all the way 
    down the key to register a digit.

    I typed all day and did some speed test on the new keyboard and I don't 
    feel the pain in my fingers. That's great!
